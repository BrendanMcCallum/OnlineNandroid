Prior to v7.50, the next / beta version of Online Nandroid was code named internally as "next". From v7.50, I have started giving code names to new versions when I start working on them. The main aim of this code naming is not to stick on to a definite version number as it is not definite if the next version will be a major version number or a point five release. New features are added during the process of development of the new version. At the time of the release, it is given a definite version number such as `v8.00`.

Additionally, only the alpha and beta versions carry the code name and not final versions. Final versions are referred with their respective version numbers.

Code names given are girl names used widely in the Maldives.

Below is a list of code names and their ultimate version numbers.
* Aisha - Version 7.5x
* Liusha - Version 8.xx
* Shifu - Version 9.xx
* Isha - Version 9.5x
* Mikko - Current alpha/beta Version
