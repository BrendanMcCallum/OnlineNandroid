#### [â†°](README.md) ONLINE NANDROID DOCUMENTATION

---

**Q:** Why does Online Nandroid require partition layout / patch files on some devices?    
**A:** Some devices does not have a reliable way to automatically detect certain partitions like boot, recovery, etc... Thus, these devices require a manually generated partition layout / patch file for Online Nandroid to function properly.

----

**Q:** Is Online Nandroid tested on all devices?    
**A:** Simple Answer - No. Long Answer - since there are a ton lot of Android devices on the market and a heck lot more custom ROM's for **each** device, it is practically impossible to test Online Nandroid on all Android devices, let alone devices officially supported. However, Online Nandroid has become so popular today that chances of Online Nandroid being tested on your device model, by someone else is vast. So, do not hesitate to try it and do not think of it as unstable software.

----

**Q:** Why do you not release public betas or push beta code on Github?    
**A:** Due to the nature of Online Nandroid, beta versions are unstable at times, and often have bugs which could prove backups done with them, unusable. Thus, it is not recommended to use backups done with beta versions as **backups**. Since I intend users and other GUI apps and tools which use Online Nandroid, to rely on the script and it's proven record of bug free-ness, beta versions should not be released to the wild. Even with the current form of closed betas, I have had people use beta versions in their ROMs, etc... not to mention people relying on beta versions for daily usage and regular backups. It is not intended for beta versions to be stable and fit for regular usage and urge all beta testers to treat beta versions as **test versions**.

**Q:** Can I use Online Nandroid in my app, GUI tool, etc...? Do I need to seek permission?    
**A:** Since Online Nandroid is released under modified-BSD style licence, you can freely use it in any of the above or otherwise. You are required to include the licence text (which is already included as header in script), and give credits to myself in the product which uses Online Nandroid. You do not need to seek my permission to use the script in your products, but I would be happier if you asked.

----

**Q:** How can I report a bug / suggest a feature in Online Nandroid?    
**A:** You can use Github's excellent issue tracker to submit bugs. Alternative you can [send me an email](mailto:ameer1234567890@gmail.com) or send a reply / direct message to [@OnlineNandroid](https://twitter.com/OnlineNandroid). You can also use the bug report options in your favourite app, GUI tool, etc... which uses Online Nandroid.

**Q:** Why did nobody made such a tool for all these years?    
**A:** Seriously... I ask myself this question all the time.

**Q:** How do I reward / donate to Online Nandroid or its developer?    
**A:** Since I do Online Nandroid mostly in my free time and allow its usage for free, I really appreciate your intention to reward / donate me. However, Paypal (world's most preferred way to get paid), does not allow sending money to Maldives, my country, and there are no payment gateways in Maldives which allows the same, unless I pay them, ofcourse. Thus, I am left with pretty much no option. But you can buy me something from [my ebay wishlist](http://my.ebay.com/wishlist/?userid=ameer_david) or buy me an [ebay Gift Card](http://giftcard.ebay.com/). Yes, I do buy stuff on ebay. If you are generous enough to actually send me some more money, [[contact me|Contact-me]] and I can provide you my bank account details for a wire transfer.
