* Almost all partition layout files for Online Nandroid were also done on the above mentioned phone.
* Partition layout files and corresponding recovery flash-able zip files for Online Nandroid are being generated using a shell script named `partlayout.sh`.
* Partition layout are added to git repos and changelogs are updated using a shell script named `gogit.sh`.
* Pushing git commits of Online Nandroid, to Github are being done with Github's official Windows client.
* Online Nandroid was initially created for my personal use, since I could not bear with having to reboot and be offline every time I run a backup, which happens quite commonly. It was since released to public.
* I do not remember why and how I selected the name "Online Nandroid".
* I have 3 android devices on which I test any new versions of Online Nandroid.
	* Samsung Relay 4G (Unlocked) - with CWM and TWRP
	* Samsung Captivate Glide (Unlocked) - with CWM and TWRP
	* MSI Windpad Enjoy 7 Plus - with no custom recovery, at the moment. I got this device recently.
* XDA community and other helpful users do most of the testing for new versions of Online Nandroid.
